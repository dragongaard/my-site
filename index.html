      <p>My name is John Taylor</p>
      <p>I am currently based in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, but have also lived in Portland (OR), Grand Rapids (MI), and Berkeley (CA).</p>
      <p>As a Research Manager at Morning Consult, I bring a unique perspective to insights research and the decision intelligence category, combining my professional experience in marketing and political consulting with my academic background. Prior to this, I worked at IMGE and Victory Phones.</p>
      <p>I received my undergraduate degree in philosophy and history from Hillsdale College, and completed additional graduate coursework in philosophy at The Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology and the Graduate Theological Union. My master's thesis focused on Martin Heidegger's critique of the Aristotelian definition of truth in relation to Thomas Aquinas' metaphysics and epistemology.</p>
      <p>Throughout my life I have been drawn to study the origins and evolution of ideas, and I'm pleased to follow that passion in my professional life: analyzing how opinion and thought shape our world.</p>
